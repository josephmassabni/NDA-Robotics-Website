# NDA-Robotics-Website
This website was my first experience with HTML and CSS. I also used Bootstrap for some styling and layout functionality. This website was created to compete in the VEX Robotics Team Website Challenge Sponsored by Dell. Overall, I am extremely happy to share my first web creation with the world; it was a fantastic learning experience.
